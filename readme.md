#Optimus Prime

Optimus Prime is a simple xsl-transformer for xml documents.  

I developed it for an university exam in 2009, so you can use it just for educational purpose ;D  
  
A complete example is available [here](../../kw_archimedes_kv_optimusprime__sample)  
And if you don't want to wander within entire project, just check this: [festival.js](../kw_archimedes_kv_optimusprime__sample/WebContent/js)
